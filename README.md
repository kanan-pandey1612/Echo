The chatbot is designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience.

Features:

Voice-based Responses: Echo responds using speech synthesis.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.

SpeechRecognition: For recognizing voice commands.

pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.

PyAudio: For handling microphone input.

OpenAI's GPT-3 (or your custom model): For natural language processing and conversation flow.

How It Works
Voice Interaction
Echo listens for your voice input and processes it using SpeechRecognition. When a command is detected, it performs actions like opening applications, telling the time, or even telling jokes.

Task Automation
Echo is integrated with various APIs and system controls, which allows it to:

Provide real-time news, weather, and stock updates.

Open applications like Notepad or Google Chrome.

Provide the current date and time.

Generate images based on user descriptions.

Usage
Start Echo by running the program.

Say your desired command (e.g., "Open Chrome," "What's the weather today?" or "Tell me a joke").

Echo will respond with either speech or perform the corresponding action.

Commands Example
"Open Notepad": Opens the Notepad application.

"What's the time?": Tells the current time.

"Tell me a joke": Echo responds with a random joke.

"Goodbye": Echo says goodbye and exits.
